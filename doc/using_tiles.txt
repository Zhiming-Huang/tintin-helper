To use data tiles, you'll need a layout loaded which supports them.  The
included layout 'full' has both a left and right panel, while 'right' has
a single panel on the right side.

To use them, you'll need to populate the right_tiles or left_tiles values:

#nop this is the height of the tile in rows;
#var right_tiles[1][height] 2

#nop this is the type of tile (only tile currently supported, box coming);
#var right_tiles[1][type] tile

#nop this is the background color of the tile;
#var right_tiles[1][color] <B5f819d>

#nop this is a simple variable, the tile will contain the contents;
#var right_tiles[1][content] area_info

#nop This tile will be directly below the first tile, but the content;
#nop is held in a list;
#var right_tiles[2][height] 10
#var right_tiles[2][type] tile
#var right_tiles[2][color] <B85678f>
#var right_tiles[2][content] group_info[%*]

All you should have to do is update the value in $area_info or $group_info[]
and use the display_right_tiles command.

The process is the same for the left, but the variable is left_tiles and you
call display_left_tiles to update the display.
